    <p> In this lab i have created a file where all my coursework for the assignment will be stored with it being titled ArchOSC assignment with a pictures file within also being created.

    In the next phase of the lab i have created a local Git repository in my assignment folder. To do this I went into my assignment folder and opened up Microsoft terminal by right clicking while in the folder and clicking run in terminal. Once Microsoft terminal opened i then typed the command git init once the flashing white cursor appeared.
     This then created the local repository as shown in the screenshot below.
